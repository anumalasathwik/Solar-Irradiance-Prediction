Introduction
Accurate prediction of solar irradiance is crucial for optimizing the performance of solar energy systems. This project utilizes machine learning models to forecast solar irradiance based on historical meteorological data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

Dataset
The data used in this project comes from the HI-SEAS weather station, covering the period from September to December 2016. The dataset includes the following features:

Solar radiation: watts per meterÂ²
Temperature: degrees Fahrenheit
Humidity: percent
Barometric pressure: Hg
Wind direction: degrees
Wind speed: miles per hour
Sunrise/sunset: Hawaii time
Note: The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle.

Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

Solar Irradiance Prediction.ipynb: The main notebook for data wrangling, feature selection, and model development.
data/: Directory to store the dataset (not included in the repository).
models/: Directory to save trained models (optional).
Installation
To run this project, you'll need to install the following Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn xgboost tensorflow
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solar-irradiance-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd solar-irradiance-prediction
Download the dataset and place it in the data/ directory.

Open the Jupyter notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Solar Irradiance Prediction.ipynb
Run all cells to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

Results
The project results in regression models predicting solar irradiance based on meteorological data. Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
