Introduction
Accurate prediction of solar irradiance is crucial for optimizing the performance of solar energy systems. This project utilizes machine learning models to forecast solar irradiance based on historical meteorological data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

Dataset
The data used in this project comes from the HI-SEAS weather station, covering the period from September to December 2016. The dataset includes the following features:

Solar radiation: watts per meterÂ²
Temperature: degrees Fahrenheit
Humidity: percent
Barometric pressure: Hg
Wind direction: degrees
Wind speed: miles per hour
Sunrise/sunset: Hawaii time
Note: The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle.
